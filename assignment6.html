    <h3>Problem 1:</h3>
    <p>What is the reward scheme for FrozenLake?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You receive a reward of 1 if you the goal and 0 otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
            The episode ends when you either reach the goal or fall into a hole.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem 2:</h3>
    <p>How big is the table used for Q-learning above?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The table used for Q-learning has a size of 64.
        </li>
        <li>
            64 = 16 * 4 = # of values in the action space * # of values in the observation space.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem 3:</h3>
    <p>Did the rewards improve over time? Why or why not?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Yes, the rewards did improve over time because of the learning algorithm used in each episode.
        </li>
        <li>
            The rewards are closer to 0 in the beginning, but after iterating over more episodes, the reward grows
            closer to 1.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem 4:</h3>
    <p>Try different values for the learning rate. What do you observe?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The algorithm perfomed poorly when the learning rate was either too close to 0 like 0.05 or close to 1 like
            0.95.
        </li>
        <li>
            After trying out multiple learning rates between 0 and 1, 0.65 seemed like it was the learning rate that
            performed the best.
        </li>
    </ul>
