    <h3>Section 1.1: Visualizing datasets using the embedding projector</h3>
    <p>Spend some time using the embedding projector to make and share observations about the MNIST data. Do the
        different digits separate into distinct clouds? Are there images that are in the wrong cloud, and can you make
        sense of why they are wrong? Are there images that are outliers from the rest of the data? Are there digits
        that seem more separate from the others, and are there pairs of digits that are more easily confused?:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For the most part, different digits do separate into different clouds but there are some digit clouds that
            overlap with another digit.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are digits that are in the wrong clouds like one of the 2's but this is
            because the 2 is written very unconventionally. It would be difficult for me to tell that the image is
            clearly
            a 2.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are few outliers from the rest of the data but usually those that are written poorly or
            unconventionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            The 1's digit cloud seems separate from the rest of the data because the single straight
            stroke is very distinct.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some other digits are more confused because they have more intricate strokes and a
            variation of ways they can be drawn. For example, the digit clouds for 7 and 9 has a lot of overlap because
            they can be written similarly, the main difference is the closed loop at the top of the 9.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 1.3: Word geometry</h3>
    <p>Experiment with various words to see if you can identify
        any insights about the data set. For example, try “politics” along the dimension from “bad” to “good”, or
        “engineer” along the spectrum from “man” to “woman”. Write up some notes on your observations, perhaps
        supplemented with a few pictures. Do you get different or better results if you use Word2Vec All instead of
        10K? Did you find any interesting examples that speak to how words are used news articles? Write up what you
        experimented with and what conclusions you drew.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When piano is searched while the left word is violin and the right word is drum, the horizontal distance
            piano is away from each of those words represents its relative frequency next to violin and drum. The other
            words shown that are closer to violin appear more often next to violin than drum and the same principle
            goes for the other words that are closer to drum.</li>
        <li>
            When politics is searched along bad to good, it is closer to bad. This shows that politics is probably used
            in a more negative sense when there is an event that makes the news.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-1.png" alt="Politics" width="600" height="400">
        <li>
            When soldier is searched along man to woman using Word2Vec 10k, it is suprisingly closer to woman. Although
            the number of men
            serving is more than the number of woman, maybe news articles are more inclined to mention some is a
            solider if they are a woman because it is rarer.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-0.png" alt="Soldier 10k" width="600" height="400">
        <li>
            When soldier is searched along man to woman using Word2Vec All, soldier ends up more in the middle of the
            two words compared to the 10k. This is probably more expected because given more data, there are more men
            in the army that can be referenced in these articles than woman.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-2.png" alt="Soldier All" width="600" height="400">
        <li>
            These experiments show that a lot of news articles are opiniated and have biases. This is shown when
            Christianity and its nearest neighbors are shown along good to bad. We all have the freedom of religion and
            which religion we align ourselves with is usually neutral. However, on this plot, we see that Christianity
            is closer to good while other religions such as Islam, Judaism, and Muslim are further from good. This
            shows that news articles do include biases which should be considered when reading the information.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Section 1.4: Finding word analogies with vector algebra</h3>
    <p>Spend a few minutes experimenting with the demo which uses Word2Vec vector algebra to solve analogies. Make a
        note of any interesting examples you find:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Math is to Equation as Physics is to Fermionic Atoms.
        </li>
        <li>
            School is to Bus as Work is to Cab.
        </li>
        <li>
            Girl is to Boy as Up is to Down.
        </li>
        <li>
            East is to Boston as West is to Seattle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Esports is to Game as Football is to Play.
        </li>
        <li>
            First is to MIT as Last is to Harvard.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 1.5: Exploring fonts with the embedding projector</h3>
    <p>1. View the fonts with PCA embedding. Do you see any clumps/areas with obvious characteristics? Record a few
        Font IDs for distinct characteristics/groupings that you find interesting (hover over a character to get its
        font ID), such as bold, italics, cursive...etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            There are some clumps with shared characteristics such as those with smoother lines instead of sharp
            corners. Some font IDs for this group are: 6477, 6022, 8180, and 7120.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another group has characters slightly leaned over to the right, some font IDs included are: 3314, 3311,
            3312, and 4139.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some of the bolder fonts are also grouped together, including the fonts: 612, 2889, 646, and 2073.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        2. Change to the embedding to T-SNE. Record how many iterations you let T-SNE run for for and whether
        or not you were able to get interesting groupings. Again, record Font IDs for interesting fonts/groupings.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I used T-SNE with 2679 iterations. This was enough in order to see clusters and groupings distance
            themselves away from the rest of the fonts.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-4.png" alt="T-SNE" width="600" height="400">
        <li>
            Fonts with thinner lines and a more italic style were grouped, the IDs included: 449, 4612, 1918, and 7389.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another group had fonts with a longer height and slimmer width style, these fonts included: 7495, 5663,
            6076, and 7477.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        3. Find a font you like, get its ID, and type that into the search bar at the right-hand side of the
        screen. Use the "neighbors" slider to isolate a few dozen points and record the Font IDs of the 10 nearest
        neighbors that make sense. Repeat this for 3 or 4 fonts. If you find a font that doesn't have nearest neighbors
        that look similar, note that down as well.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Font #2223, Nearest Ten Fonts: 2234, 4404, 4403, 2737, 3712, 2235, 7825, 5813, 2236, and 6005
        </li>
        <li>
            Font #5644, Nearest Ten Fonts: 5642, 5643, 395, 7920, 23, 7637, 3869, 3870, 394, and 3868
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Font #6463, Nearest Ten Fonts: 6501, 7021, 6492, 1897, 4149, 3763, 1896, 1187, 6687, and 4329
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Section 2.3: Generating new fonts</h3>
    <p> 0. Edit FontModel.js so another character besides "r" is being displayed as the sample character for the 40
        attributes. Edit Alphabet.vue so that all of the uppercase, lowercase, and numerical sample font characters are
        displayed in the right side of the screen instead of just the lowercase characters. Take a screenshot for your
        writeup.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            "b" is now displayed as the sample character and it shows uppercase, lowercase, and numbers on the right
            side of the screen.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-5.png" alt="All Characters" width="600" height="400">
    </ul>

    <p> 1. Edit VectorChooser.vue to add a new button under the "Apply vector math" button. The new button should show
        the font Id of the "nearest neighbor" font that is "most similar to" the current font, out of all the fonts in
        the 50K training set.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Using a bolder font:
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-6.png" alt="Similar" width="600" height="400">
        <img src="pics/assignment4-7.png" alt="Similar" width="500" height="400">
        <li>
            Using a dotted type font:
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-8.png" alt="Similar" width="600" height="400">
        <img src="pics/assignment4-9.png" alt="Similar" width="500" height="400">
        <li>
            When the nearest font is less similar with added curls:
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-10.png" alt="Similar" width="600" height="400">
        <img src="pics/assignment4-11.png" alt="Similar" width="500" height="400">
    </ul>

    <p>2. What is the “average” of a set of fonts? (Hint: What does that mean in terms of the 40 dimensions)? Write
        some code to Find the nearest font neighbor to the average font. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The average font is the font with vector values that are the average for each of the 40 dimensions.
        </li>
        <li>
            The nearest font neighbor to the average font is 23607 which turns out to be pretty surprising.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-12.png" alt="Average" width="800" height="400">
    </ul>

    <p>3a. What does adding this vector to a font do? Does it perform bolding well at thickening the original font? Are
        there other characteristics that seem to also carry over? Try this with another characteristic. It may be
        helpful to use the characteristics you gathered previously.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Adding the vector does seem to add bolding to the original font.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-13.png" alt="Before" width="600" height="400">
        <img src="pics/assignment4-14.png" alt="After" width="600" height="400">
        <li>
            However, the general smoothness of the strokes is one characteristic that carries over. Sharp corners still
            remain corners and smooth edges and still smooth.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-15.png" alt="Before" width="600" height="400">
        <img src="pics/assignment4-16.png" alt="After" width="600" height="400">
    </ul>

    <p>
        3b. Find 10 fonts for a specific quality (i.e. bolding, dotting, fancy, serif...etc) and average them out to
        find a characteristic vector (for example, “bolding vector”). Try applying that vector to another font. Again,
        you can do this by manual computation and then modifying the added vector in the "Apply Vector Math" button, or
        you can make new buttons. Does it work better or worse than the previous one-sample method? Try this with at
        least 2 characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The transformations below are made from this starting font:</li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-13.png" alt="Starting" width="600" height="400">

        <li>
            Finding 10 fonts with bold and then applying vector math bold - 10 button. It looks like it has about the
            same effect as the single bold when applied.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-17.png" alt="Bolder" width="600" height="400">

        <li>
            Finding 10 fonts with more unique and wild styles and then applying vector math bold - 10 button.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-18.png" alt="Wilder" width="600" height="400">
    </ul>

    <p>
        3c. Find 10 fonts the exhibit for a specific characteristic and 10 fonts for the opposite of that
        characteristic (i.e. bold vs. corresponding non-bold). Subtract the vectors for each pair and take the average
        difference. How does this work as a vector for the characteristic (e.g., as a "bolding vector")? Does this work
        better or worse than the method above to obtain your desired characteristic? Try this with at least 2
        characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Finding 10 fonts with bold and then 10 with non bold fonts while taking the average difference between
            pairs resulted in an extremely bold font when this was applied.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-19.png" alt="Very Bold" width="600" height="400">

        <li>
            Finding 10 fonts with background and then 10 with non background fonts while taking the average difference between
            pairs resulted in a large background presence font when this was applied.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-20.png" alt="Very Background" width="600" height="400">
    </ul>

    <p>
        4. Can you figure out how to create a vector that makes uppercase fonts lowercase? (Hint: You can try finding
        fonts that only have uppercase/lowercase characters and finding analogous vectors, or you can try playing with
        the 40 attribute sliders directly.)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Applying this lowercase vector does a pretty good job of making the upper and lower case letters of a font similar.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-21.png" alt="lowercase" width="600" height="400">
    </ul>

    <p>
        5. Can you create a vector based on your personal font tastes (i.e. a personal-likeable vector)? Please also
        make note of any interesting vector directions you find.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I chose a favorite vector that represents a style with thick and curly edges which really make the letters stand out.
        </li>
        <img src="pics/assignment4-22.png" alt="bubbly" width="600" height="400">
    </ul>
