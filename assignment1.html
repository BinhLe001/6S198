    <h3>Section 4: Examining Confidence Levels</h3>
    <p>Added button behavior to alert the number of top K closest matches in each class and the confidences when clicked.</p>

    <p>When training two classes with the same image set of a neutral facial expression the confidence never really converged
        at a number but fluctuated depending on tiny changes of the camera image. The number for the top 20 matches was 8,
        12, 0 and the confidence was 0.4, 0.6, 0 at the time of pressing the alert button. This means the system was unsure
        about its classification of the current input. This makes sense since the two image sets are nearly identical.</p>

    <p>When training three classes with three different objects (phone, water bottle, and candy), the confidence was correctly
        near 100% whenever a certain object was held up to the camera. When the water bottle was held up to the camera, the
        number for the top 20 matches was 0, 20, 0 with a confidence of 0, 1, 0. This means that the system is good at differentiating
        inanimate objects that are different in shape and color.</p>

    <p>When training two classes with pictures of my face and my partner’s face, the confidence was nearly 100% when our
        faces were at a certain distance and alignment to the camera. The top 20 matches were 20, 0, 0 and the confidence
        was 1, 0, 0 when my face was upright and fit entirely in the input image. But when our faces were at various extreme
        distances (near/far) or rotated, the confidence was more variant.</p>

    <h3>Section 5: Scaling Confidence Values</h3>

    <p>The confidence values were scaled by ignoring the classes with less than 3 top K images and reweighing the probabilities
        by dividing the number of top K images for each class by the total number of top K images from classes with at least
        3 top K images. This method hopefully ignores some of the noise from classes with only 1 or 2 top K images in order
        to prioritize classes with a much more significant number of top K images.</p>

    <p>I trained three classes with different facial expression (smile, resting, and frown). I used both the default confidence
        value calculation in addition to considering only the classes with at least 3 top K images. I think that the at least
        3 top K images method works better because when I presented a resting image to the system, there was less noise in
        the confidences and it was more confident that I was presenting a resting face. However, with the default method,
        there would be instances when 1 or 2 images from the smiling and frowning class made the top K images and the confidences
        would be more variant although I didn’t change my resting face. </p>

    <p> I think my alternative method would be useful when the three classes of images are mostly similar and there are only
        slight differences. By ignoring classes with less than 3 top K images, it could help eliminate noise and the class
        outliers with only 1 or 2 images showing up on the top K images so that there is a more confident prediction for
        the classes with many top K images.</p>

    <p>Note that the confiddence values in the alert window as the confidence shown on live displays are delayed and do not
        correlate with the values at the time of the button press. This image shows that there is still a 0.05 confidence
        prediction when 1 of the top K images match the frown class when using the default confidence scaling.</p>
    <img src="pics/assignment1-4.png" alt="Default Confidence Scaling" width="600" height="400">
    <p>This image shows that there is a 0 confidence prediction when 2 of the top K images match the frown class when using
        the alternate confidence scaling. This method boosts the confidence of classes with many images in the top K images.
    </p>

    <h3>Section 6: Limiting Training Examples</h3>
    <p>The number of training examples were limited so that the green class has a maximum of 5 images, the purple class has
        a maximum of 20 images, and the orange class has a maximum of 50 images. Once the maximum was hit, a window alert
        would pop up and let the user know that no more images could be added. There was a global variables for each class
        limit and the code checks if a certain classes number of images had reached that max before deciding to add an image
        or alert the user. </p>
    <img src="pics/assignment1-7.png" alt="Class Image Limits" width="600" height="600">

    <p>In this example, I train classes with three different objects (vitamin bottle, contact solution, wet wipes) with a
        limit of 5 images for vitamins, 20 for contact solution, and 50 for wet wipes. When holding up the vitamin bottle,
        all 5 vitamin bottle images in the class were included in the top K images but because of the confidence calculation,
        there is only 25% confidence because the 15 other images must be from another class. This shows that if we have very
        different limits on the number of images for each class, we would also have to rethink our confidence calculations
        in order to take care of cases where classes do not have at least K images to be in the top K images.</p>
    <img src="pics/assignment1-8.png" alt="Image Limits Objects" width="600" height="400">

    <p>In this example, I train classes with three slightly different facial expressions (frown, resting, smile) with a limit
        of 5 images for frown, 20 for resting, and 50 for smiling. When I presented a resting face as input, the system was
        only 20% confident that I was showing a resting face and it was 79% confident that it was a smile. This shows that
        because the class images consisted of only slightly different expressions, it could not tell the two expressions
        apart. Also because of the sheer number of images in the smile class, it was more likely to include those in the
        top K images and wrongly skew the confidence predictions. </p>

    <h3>Section 7: Further Explorations</h3>
    <p>For this section, I decided to adjust the value of K and see how that affects confidence predictions. I used a similar
        test where I trained 3 classes with slightly different facial expressions (frown, resting, smile), using 40 images
        for each class. I first used a K value of 5. When I presented a resting face as input, it returned 99% confidence
        that it was a resting face.</p>
    <img src="pics/assignment1-13.png" alt="Large K Value" width="300" height="200">
    <img src="pics/assignment1-10.png" alt="Small K Value" width="600" height="400">

    <p>However, when I did the same test with a K value of 35, the results were very different. When I presented a resting
        face as input, it returned a confidence of only 61% for a resting face. This shows that by having a large K value,
        it doesn't really differentiate any of the images in the top K images. It only cares about if the image is in the
        top K matches not if it is the most similar match or the least similar match. With the K value of 5 and a total 120
        test images, the images making the top 5 matches were more likely to be a part of the resting face class. But when
        K was 35, it was likely that images from other classes would be included because the image classes were mostly similar
        other than the facial expressions.</p>
